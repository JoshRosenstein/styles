# TODO

- [ ] Pull `@emotion/sheet` code and make it style sheets extractable for SSR
  - See https://github.com/emotion-js/emotion/tree/master/packages/create-emotion-server
- [ ] Figure out if we want a `css` utility for creating a single class name and determine
      how/if that'd work with SSR. Does it return a string class name, a function, or an object?
